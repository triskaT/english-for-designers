Comparing yourself to others

[00:00:00] Hello? I am. Tomáš Tříška And I would like to talk to you about comparing yourself to others. Everyone has been compared to other people. Especially while growing up as a child. It could be between siblings. Other family members or childhood friend. It's very natural thing to do, and yet it can be harmful to us. 

Let's start where every one start which is being children.the earliest time a child is being compared to someone else's when they have a sibling or cousins. For example, there is the excelling son of the family and the youngest son who can't get to his older brother's level. Let's call them Charlie and Johnny. Charlie, the older brother. Is doing well at school sports hobbies, helping at home. while his younger brother, Johnny. Is [00:01:00] trying his best, but he is not able to achieve the same level as his brother. 

Parents have gotten used to a certain standard. That they expect of their child. When Johnny itchy was something he couldn't do before the parents take it as a norm since. Charlie. The older brother never struggled with it. Because of this, Johnny can feel this pressure growing up. And he fights it. For a long time. 

At some point. He gives up. When trying to impress his parents since, his effort was not acknowledged. He starts doing bare minimum. In general, his outlook on life can become a lot more negative. Is more prone to depression just from comparison. 

This is speaking so far, only from the parents side. Friends, classmates teachers or other family members. [00:02:00] Comparing and judging you. Now multiply that by social media. Kids nowadays. Get exposed to a lot more information about each other and to a lot more judging as well. Children can get addicted to social media via dopamine hits. 

They get these from posting, for likes and consuming stories and posts of others. They see all the people online, doing amazing things. The truth is people tend to post only the best versions of themselves. It's sort of a facade. That people put up and try to look as good as possible. This would make them happy, even though they are not doing so great. Financially or mentally. 

Comparing yourself to others can be harmful. I see this. A lot online in games. Or with new [00:03:00] aspiring artists or people going to the gym. Being embarrassed about their progress and feeling self-conscious. It is very much about our self-esteem. I can relate a lot.
When I finished high school, I had no idea what to do next. I didn't have an overall plan or any grand dream to work towards. I tried two different universities before ending up at the one I ended up.this was actually very hard on me mentally. I decided to pursue something which had nothing to do with my previous education. It can create this sense of inferiority. Of being behind. The feeling of not being at the same level as others from the same class or friend circle that I grew up with. It can affect you hard enough to sort of paralyze you. Where you get so depressed you can't bring yourself to do things you need to do. 

Now [00:04:00] I'll move on to another example. I will use a game called Trackmania where you drive with cars or maps of your choice. It is a racing game with leaderboards. So people try to drive fast as possible. When you start playing the game, you won't be able to. Fight for the top spots in the leaderboards. You can try your best improve and beat your personal best. But for a lot of newer players at this tough pill to swallow. They drive on a new map they like for hours, could be 5, 10, 15 hours. Or more to achieve certain time. Then they go watch their favorite streamer of Trackmania. Watch them beat their time in matter of minutes, 10 to 15 minutes. It is disheartening to watch all your efforts get overcome in matter of minutes. 

But people should always remember. The people you look up [00:05:00] to, have a certain amount of skill in what they do. Be it gaming, art fitness music. Anything that requires time and effort to master. 
These people had already spent a ridiculous amount of time getting good. Again, example with trick mania you spent. 15 hours on a map. But you played the game for only 100 to 500 hours. You then compare yourself to people that have thousands of hours. most of the top. Players. I have been playing for over 10 years. 

They have over. 10 to 15,000hours played. Of course there will be outliers natural talent. People that have experience from similar game. They can catch up a lot quicker to that level than people that have no experience with it. 

But I would say focus on yourself. Try [00:06:00] to overcome your own limits. Use the information you can get from the people that inspire you. Try to get to their level. However don't feel disheartened that you are not close to them yet. Make small improvements over time. Practice and you will see improvements. Remember that you cannot change your past. Only your future. Don't well on lost opportunity earlier in life. Focus on yourself. Day by day and eventually you will make it. Everyone has a different starting point. So focus on your own start. Your own journey after all it is your life you are living not someone elses. .
