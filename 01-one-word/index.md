# “Thingy“

English is hard.

I’ve always found learning English hard. As non-native speakers we were thought all these words and their meanings. Over time we piled on more difficult vocabulary. All to be able to describe things we see, hear or think.

Once an annoyance became a sense of pride. I can give things their proper name. I can speak. I understand. I can communicate.

Then I met the word „Thingy“. My girlfriend is English native speaker. When she can’t remember the name, she replaces it with „thingy“. A convenience. It replaces all needed vocabulary. After all it means anything.

Right away I felt in danger. I no longer have to remember names of items I forgot. Instead I can just say „thingy“.
I felt a dumb for learning all these words. Only to be shown they get replaced by native english speaker anyway.
I tried to avoid it, but over time I have started to use this cursed word as well. Not as much as my girlfriend. Still enough times to start seeing side effects.
Not giving myself time to remember words made it harder to do so later. Words don’t enter my head as fast as they used to.
I now felt even dumber. I feel like I ate devils fruit.
If the whole world starts saying just „thingy“ it will be the end. 
Everything will be one and the same. No more color in language. Only one color. One word. One curse.

Learning language is hard. It’s also amazing to be able to communicate. To accurately describe what we mean. It is a gift. So let’s not lose what we learn. Let’s hold it dear as a christmas present from our parents.
