#First impression

_Hello there, I’m Tomas,_
_aspiring 24 year old artist who loves playing games, listening to music, reading manga,manhwa, playing chess, challenging my own brain and delving into storytelling._
_I have gone many different paths while growing up, until I ended up back with what I enjoyed very young. Drawing. Since I have gotten on this path recently I don’t have projects that I have worked on. One that I would mention was my first +30 sec animation._

##Featured project

###Last Breath
![A thumb like character representing a cell with one eye](02-first-impression/thumb-cell.png)
- *A short 50 sec animation about cells dying inside persons lungs from smoking*.
- *It was my first project and even though it’s very rough around the edges I’m proud of it*.



Most of the time now I practice gesture drawing:


My goal is to make my ideas come to life for others to enjoy, just like I enjoy in games or stories.

- *As I mentioned I really enjoy playing chess. When I was very young around 7 years old my grandpa taught me how to move the pieces. Now 14 years later I came back to it and started learning chess properly. In the past 3 years I have gotten to around expert level and I am hoping to improve and play against stronger opponents*.
