# Voice Tone and style

## Voice:

**Open:** I like to talk about things, be it everyday talk or deep topics for long discussions.

**Mindfulness and empathy:** I try to be mindful of others and their opinions. To try and view things from multiple angles. My mom gifted me with empathy which helps me understand others better.

**Authentic:** I want to be truthfully with what I say. I try not to blurt out anything I think about a topic I donâ€™t fully understand. I want my words to hold value.

## Tone:

**Encouraging:** I have went through long depressing periods. This makes me want to help others be it just a tiny bit. I want to make them smile and see that there is a way.

**Fun:** Having fun is important and to me it is something I try to share with others.

**Melancholy:** I do still enjoy dabbeling in serious and sad topics mainly in fantasy world.

## Style:

**Grammar:** I try to be grammatically accurate. Grammer was my weak side at school, however the better I got at English over all, the more I want to be accurate.

**Friends:** When talking to my friends I use mixed czech and english. I also use a lot of emotes or memes to answer or react.

**Professional:** At school my english learning was focused on getting to advanced level. I got my C1 certificate. This has made me get used to writing in more complex sentences and words. Now I try to keep my text approachable, yet still advanced.
